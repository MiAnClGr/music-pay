MUSIC-PAY

A web3 solution for reliable and trustless payment from Booking agent to Artist

Currently:

An artist can create a profile and log in with their Metamask wallet. The profile is stored on chain as a smart contract that can receive the bookings and payment.

A booking agent can search for an artist and make a booking.

Bookings will be displayed dynamically on the artist profile page.

Soon to be added:

Proof of booking and proof of payment NFTs that will be minted to both artist and agent

The escrow page
