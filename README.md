MUSIC-PAY

A web3 solution for reliable and trustless payment from Booking agent to Artist

Music-Pay is a work in progress and new features are being added frequently


Currently:

An artist can create a profile and log in with their Ethereum address and Metamask wallet, the profile is stored on chain as a smart contract holds the logic to receive and store bookings and receive and transfer payment.

An artist can upload a profile picture to their Artist page, the file is saved on IPFS and the file url is stored in the Artist Profile contract.

A booking agent can search for an artist, view their profile and make a booking.

If an Artist accepts a booking they will be directed to an Escrow page, an Escrow smart contract that controls the flow of the transaction will be deployed to the Blockchain, the contract will be accessible through the Escrow page by both the Artist and Agent 

Booking agents are able to view a list of current escrows that they are a part of and access the escrow page through this list


Soon to be added:

Proof of booking and proof of payment NFTs that will be minted to both artist and agent
